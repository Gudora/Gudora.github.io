      Responsibilities include:
      - Developed the miniCTX benchmark to evaluate large language models in formal mathematics, focusing on real-world proof generation using context information.
      - Fine-tuned deepseek-coder-1.3B model using file-tuning data, which incorporates context information alongside traditional state-tactic pairs, outperforming larger models like Llemma-7B and GPT-4o.

## About Me

I am a master’s student in the Master’s in Machine Learning ([MSML](https://www.ml.cmu.edu/academics/5th-year-ms.html)) program at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/), advised by Professor [Sean Welleck](https://wellecks.com/). My research focuses on enhancing the logical reasoning capabilities of language models, with a particular emphasis on mathematical reasoning and interpretability. I aim to bridge the gap between human understanding and machine reasoning, enabling AI to excel in rigorous tasks like theorem proving, complex planning, and decision-making.
