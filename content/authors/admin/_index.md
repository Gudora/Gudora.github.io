    Advised by Prof. [Sean Welleck](https://wellecks.com/)
      - Developed the miniCTX benchmark to evaluate large language models in formal mathematics, focusing on real-world proof generation using context information.
      - Fine-tuned deepseek-coder-1.3B model using file-tuning data, which incorporates context information alongside traditional state-tactic pairs, outperforming larger models like Llemma-7B and GPT-4o.
      - Developed a Python wrapper for Lean REPL, simplifying interactions with Lean and enhancing usability.
      - Planning to extend the benchmark to areas beyond math, such as program verification, and to evaluate premise selection methods.

    summary: |2-
    Advised by Prof. [Paul Liang](https://www.mit.edu/~ppliang/) and Prof. [Louis-Philippe Morency](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~morency/)
      - Developed a real-time multitasking framework for Open Face 3.0, supporting comprehensive facial behavior analysis including landmark detection, action unit detection, facial expression recognition, and gaze estimation.
      - Enhanced toolkit accessibility by developing Python bindings that support both Open Face 2.0 and Open Face 3.0, enabling more flexible integration into computer vision applications.
      - Implemented generative models for data augmentation, specifically targeting non-frontal face images, to enhance facial landmark detection and emotion recognition accuracy.

## About Me

I am a master’s student in the Master’s in Machine Learning ([MSML](https://www.ml.cmu.edu/academics/5th-year-ms.html)) program at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/), advised by Professor [Sean Welleck](https://wellecks.com/). My research focuses on enhancing the logical reasoning capabilities of language models, with a particular emphasis on mathematical reasoning and interpretability. I aim to bridge the gap between human understanding and machine reasoning, enabling AI to excel in rigorous tasks like theorem proving, complex planning, and decision-making.
